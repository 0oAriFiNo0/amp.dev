"With the recent shift to mobile, media consumption is changing. Users now "
"consume content wherever they find it -- sometimes it’s directly from a "
"publisher’s website, oftentimes it’s not. Given how frustrating the mobile "
"web can be, many content distribution platforms are seeking alternatives. In "
"many cases, these alternatives tend to be platform specific, placing a burden"
" on the publishers to support this fragmentation of formats and closing off "
"the ecosystem.<br/><br/> The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project is an "
"initiative to improve the mobile web and enhance the distribution ecosystem. "
"If content is fast, flexible and beautiful, including compelling and "
"effective ads, we can preserve the open web publishing model as well as the "
"revenue streams so important to the sustainability of quality "
"publishing.<br/><br/> AMP HTML is a new way to make web pages that are "
"optimized to load instantly on users’ mobile devices. It is designed to "
"support smart caching, predictable performance, and modern, beautiful mobile "
"content. Since AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies, and not a "
"template based system, publishers continue to host their own content, "
"innovate on their user experiences, and flexibly integrate their advertising "
"and business models -- all within a technical architecture optimized for "
"speed and performance."

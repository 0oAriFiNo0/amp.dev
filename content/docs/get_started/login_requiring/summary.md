In this tutorial I explored how to combine `amp-access` and `amp-form` to realize a comment section enabled by a login. I focused mostly on how we used those 2 components more than documenting them, while describing how we implemented a sample published on [ampbyexample.com.](https://ampbyexample.com/) In order to show the interaction between the component and a server, the sample provides a simple backend implementation which uses a cookie to save the login status.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use data binding and expressions to build awesome, interactive AMP pages with [`<amp-bind>`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-bind.html).

<div class="img-right">
<amp-img  src="/static/img/docs/tutorials/interactivity-final-page.png"
         width="415" height="738" layout="responsive"
         alt="Sample e-commerce product page">
</amp-img>
</div>

## What you'll build

You'll build an e-commerce product page that:

- Uses AMP HTML and AMP components for a fast and rich user experience.
- Includes cross-element interactivity by using `<amp-bind>`.
- Fetches additional product data on demand by using `<amp-state>`.

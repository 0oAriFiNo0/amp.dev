An AMP Story is a full-screen visual storytelling experience that conveys information with images, videos, graphics, audio, and more. It's perfect for users who want bite-sized, visually-rich content.  

The basic ingredients that go into an AMP Story are individual **pages**. These pages, in turn, are composed of individual **layers** that contain basic HTML and AMP **elements**.

Each of those ingredients are translated into AMP components, where the story is represented by `amp-story`, the page is represented by `amp-story-page`, and the layers are represented by `amp-story-grid-layer`.

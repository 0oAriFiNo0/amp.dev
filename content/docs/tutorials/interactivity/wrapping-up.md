Congratulations! You just created an interactive e-commerce product detail page with variable sizes and prices for each SKU, fetched on-demand from a remote JSON endpoint.

You learned how to:

- Use `<amp-state>` to fetch product information (color, size, availability).
- Use `<amp-bind>` to create cross-element interactions.
- Create a fast and rich user experience with AMP!

If you got stuck, see the `static/final.html` file for the complete solution.

## Next steps

Learn more about the power and flexibility of building interactive AMP page in the  [`<amp-bind>`](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-bind.html) documentation.

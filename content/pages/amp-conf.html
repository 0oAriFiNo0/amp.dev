  <h1>AMP Conf 2018 is turning Amsterdam into AMPsterdam.</h1>
  <ul class="facts">
    <li>Feb 13/14, 2018</li>
    <li>Free (as in beer)</li>
    <li>For developers and designers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AMP Conf is coming back in 2018, which means two days of talks by developers for developers, all crafted to help you create the best user experiences possible. With more pure CSS talks, more applied knowledge and maybe probably live coding (gasp!), we'll go deep in how to achieve UX excellence, not just basic functionality.</p>

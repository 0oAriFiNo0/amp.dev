  title@: Instant. Everywhere.
  content@: For many, reading on the mobile web is a slow, clunky and frustrating experience - but it doesn’t have to be that way. The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project is an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere.

section_one:
  title@: An architectural framework built for speed
  content@: With the recent shift to mobile, media consumption is changing. Users now consume content wherever they find it -- sometimes it’s directly from a publisher’s website, oftentimes it’s not. Given how frustrating the mobile web can be, many content distribution platforms are seeking alternatives. In many cases, these alternatives tend to be platform specific, placing a burden on the publishers to support this fragmentation of formats and closing off the ecosystem.<br/><br/>
            The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project is an initiative to improve the mobile web and enhance the distribution ecosystem. If content is fast, flexible and beautiful, including compelling and effective ads, we can preserve the open web publishing model as well as the revenue streams so important to the sustainability of quality publishing.<br/><br/>
            AMP HTML is a new way to make web pages that are optimized to load instantly on users’ mobile devices. It is designed to support smart caching, predictable performance, and modern, beautiful mobile content. Since AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies, and not a template based system, publishers continue to host their own content, innovate on their user experiences, and flexibly integrate their advertising and business models -- all within a technical architecture optimized for speed and performance.

  subtitle@: Seamless, simplified publishing
  content@: AMP HTML embraces the open web, so you can be sure that your content appears correctly across all modern browsers and apps. Pages are published normally to your site, using standard tools, and are accelerated via caches created by Google and others.

      quote: “The mobile open web experience is terrible and some have suggested it's too slow to compete. We can choose to see the mobile open web as a relic of its time and flee to the warm embrace of closed platforms and apps. Or we can say that the open web means something important to the world and if it’s broken it’s our job to fix it. I think we should fix it. That’s why Chartbeat is proud to be a part of the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project. It’s our attempt to fix the mobile experience, make it fast and beautiful, and ensure the future of an open web.”

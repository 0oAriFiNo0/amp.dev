  title@: Better ads on a faster web.
  paragraph@: We can't make the web better if we don't fix ads. Today's ads fail to meet their goals because they are slow, unpredictable, and disruptive. The open-source AMP Ads Initiative aims to make advertising on the web better with faster, lighter, and safer ad experiences, across all points in the user journey.'

what:
  title@: What are AMP ads?
  paragraph@: AMP Ads are a new, better way of building, delivering, and measuring ads that are faster, lighter, and more secure. AMP Ads are built using AMP+HTML and many of the smart components that make AMP pages fast (like amp-analytics). These ads are only delivered after being validated, ensuring that they’re free of malware. Most of all, these ads can be delivered anywhere on the web, not just on AMP pages.

why:
  title@: Why AMP ads?
  reasons:
    - title@: Faster ads drive better&nbsp;performance
      paragraph@: AMP Ads are 6x faster than regular ads on AMP pages, making them more viewable, more effective, and more likely to perform&nbsp;well.
      icon: amp-ads/speed_icon.svg

    - title@: Lighter ads lead to better ad&nbsp;experiences
      paragraph@: Heavy and unpredictable ad experiences slow down the page, cost users money, and can hurt your brand. AMP Ads are 3x lighter and the AMP framework guarantees that these ads only behave as intended so users always have a positive experience with your&nbsp;brand.
      icon: amp-ads/lighter_ads.svg

    - title@: Safer ads build trust in your&nbsp;brands
      paragraph@: AMP ads need to be validated before they're served, eliminating the risk of malware and building trust in the brands users are engaging&nbsp;with.

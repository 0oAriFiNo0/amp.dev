User experience has always been a major focus at Gizmodo, the popular design, technology, and science fiction blog. With over half of traffic visiting their mobile website, keeping the site clear and fast is key to keeping readers on mobile devices engaged with their content.

Over the past two years Gizmodo has implemented a number of optimizations to improve page load times, such as removing unnecessary scripts, setting a fallback font for web fonts and lazy loading below-the-fold site components. Yet, the team still felt like more could be done to improve performance for their mobile users. Josh Laurito, Head of Data and Analytics, highlighted their main challenge: “We delivered the same (large) JavaScript & CSS payloads to users on mobile and desktop, making it difficult to improve one experience without degrading the other.” With the launch of AMP, Gizmodo saw an opportunity to address this obstacle.

## Solution

Gizmodo implemented AMP in May of 2016 and is now publishing AMP pages for 100% their posts, as well as creating AMP versions of previous work. Gizmodo has been early to test and adopt new AMP features. They are among the first to publish reader comments and conversations on AMP articles. According to Laurito, the most pleasant surprise of AMP has been “the wide adoption of the standard, which has led to a quick uptick in support from vendors and the appearance of our AMP pages in a wider variety of settings.”

As of September, 2016 Gizmodo has published [X AMP Pages] and are receiving 100k visits to those AMP pages daily. AMP has been highly successful in making Gizmodo’s mobile pages fast  --  page load time for AMP is 3x as fast as their regular mobile site. AMP has even helped Gizmodo attract new readers. Eighty-percent of Gizmodo’s traffic from AMP pages is new traffic, demonstrating the impact of the format in generating new visitors.

It is still early days for AMP, and Gizmodo is looking forward to seeing how the format evolves over time. Laurito said

  > “We would like “[the ability] to host AMP on our own CDN, support for more high-impact ad units, and broader capacity to recommend stories to our readers.”

Overall, migrating to AMP has made a meaningful difference to Gizmodo’s mobile experience. “AMP has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for Gizmodo,” added Laurito.

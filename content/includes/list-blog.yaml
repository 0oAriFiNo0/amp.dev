    excerpt: 'Today we are announcing a change to the domain scheme of the Google AMP Cache. Beginning soon, the Google AMP Cache will serve each site from its own subdomain of https://cdn.ampproject.org. This change will allow content served from the Google AMP Cache to be protected by the fundamental security model of the web: the HTML5 origin.'

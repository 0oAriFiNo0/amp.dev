      <h1>AMP Ads</h1>
      <h5>These days, if it isn’t instant – it's not fast enough. Even the most memorable creative won’t serve its purpose if the ad is slow and disruptive for a user.</h5>
      <p>AMP is fundamentally changing the way ads are built, delivered and measured on the web, making them faster and minimizing disruptions for users. This increases viewability and click-through rates to improve monetization, making everyone happy: users, publishers and advertisers alike.</p>
      <p>Advertising continues to be the cornerstone of every publisher’s business model; AMP is fundamentally changing the way ads are built and delivered on the web by supporting ads that are fast, safe, compelling and effective for users. </p>

      <h1>A faster way to grow your business</h1>
      <p>A growing number of publishers and advertisers are adopting AMP to deliver faster and more engaging content to their users. As your clients embrace the speed of AMP and more users consume content on AMP pages, ensure that your business is positioned for the future and integrate your technology with AMP. Speeding up ads is the fastest way to boost performance.</p>
      <p>AMP ads greatly improve the mobile internet through their intelligent design and pre-loading features. This leads to increased traffic, higher sales conversion rates and more pages per visit – delivering the value you’re looking for in your ads.</p>
      <p>Although AMP pages support traditional HTML ads, these ads can be slow to load. To make ads themselves as fast as the rest of the AMP page, you can build ads in AMPHTML.</p>
      <p>AMPHTML ads load as fast as content, increasing viewability and enticing engagement. AMPHTML ads are only delivered after being validated, ensuring that the ads are free of malware.</p>
      <p>Ads created with AMPHTML are served on both AMP and non-AMP pages. By building an ad with AMP, you can deliver a memorable brand experience everywhere without worrying about speed and platform compatibility.</p>

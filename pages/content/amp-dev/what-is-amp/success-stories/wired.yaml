    headline: Challenge
    text: Wired’s philosophy is to meet audiences wherever they are online. The San Francisco-based print and online publisher reports on technology and its impact on politics, culture, and the economy. The publisher saw AMP as an opportunity to speed up the mobile experience as well as to be eligible for the AMP-powered Google Search Top Stories carousel. Samuel Baldwin, Product Manager for Wired.com, said “Site performance is a company-wide KPI, and we see our work on AMP as furthering the business need of providing a fast, clean user experience to our audience.”

    headline: Solution
    text: The team at Wired.com took a measured approach to rolling out AMP. They began by creating AMP pages for all stories published in 2016. After a few months of positive data with that group, they expanded coverage to include the entire 24-year archive of Wired.com, over 100k stories. There are a few exceptions, however. At the moment they currently exclude digital interactives, high impact feature stories, liveblogs (these pages will be implemented in AMP soon), and any story that has an image gallery in it.

    headline: Result
    text: "Offline UX was an important part of the PWA experience, given the network infrastructure and customers’ predominantly low-end smartphones. Wired emphasized good caching, offline fallback pages, and auto-refresh pages upon internet availability. After implementing AMP and PWA, they reached four important mobile milestones: a 5X jump in conversion rates, a 40% increase in organic traffic, 65% faster page load times, and a 60% lower bounce rate, which highlighted better engagement.<br><br>“By solving for landing-page speed with AMP and offering consistent fast experience with PWA, we can build better products for our users,” says Prashant Mahajan, Wired product manager. “AMP and PWA proved to be worthwhile investments,” adds Anton Saputro, product lead for mobile web. “We saw improved user engagement and 5X better conversion rates on PWA than on the original mobile web flow.”<br><br>The e-commerce company expects to continue working on a feedback and product-improvement cycle to optimize their AMP and PWA experience.Wired also will start using AMP pages in search engine marketing (SEM) and Google Ads campaigns."
